### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. When dealing with waterfall style step function calcuations, copy/paste is your bestfriend. I spent an hour just to realize I made a careless typo.
2. .innerHTML/.value/.selectedIndex are all things I need more practice with. I am spending way too long figuring out when to use each.
3. I really wish I took the time to learn git a while ago. I delete/remake repositories way too often and it is getting tedious.
